# Al Roker
Al Roker - The New Relic / Ducksboard Daily Reporter

## Why did I call this Al Roker?

**_Here's what's happening in your neck of the woods._**

Every morning my wife turns on the Today Show while we're getting ready. So over the years, I've become used to Al and his crew giving me the important news of the day. So just like Al, this script can be used to produce a daily report of what's important... in your apps.

Eventually, the plan is to make this script execute on a schedule (i.e. CRON) and be able to email the reports out to a mailing list.
